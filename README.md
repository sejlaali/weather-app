# Weather App!!!

Wait a second... I think I've heard that before...

Yup! You've built a weather app already, BUT now you will rebuild it using ***REACT***! 😱

### Open Weather API

 You should recall working with the **[Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api)**. If you don't, check out the [original readme](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-thunderbolt/open-weather-api-lab).


## ⚡️ Requirements:

Your app has multiple components and does the following things:

- Handles the zip code input from the user
- Fetches data from the API when the zip code is submitted
- Parses the information that comes back from the API call
- Renders that information on the page
- **BONUS**: Include the sunrise and sunset times (hint: maybe [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) will be helpful!) and some information about humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.

Ponder this (*React way of thinking*):

- Should your app have state?
- How/when would you change state?
- What way will you make the API call?
- What Components will you have?
